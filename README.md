🚀 Insights

Movies dominate (~70%) but TV Shows help with long-term engagement.

Most new content is added in December, January, July (holiday months).

Content is spread across many countries, but heavily skewed towards the US & India.

Dramas, comedies, and thrillers are top genres.

Data has some missing values (e.g., directors, country).

✅ Recommendations

Release more content during holiday months.

Focus on local-language productions to grow internationally.

Maintain a good balance of movies vs. TV shows.

Expand family & kids content to engage households.

Invest more in popular genres like drama, comedy, and thrillers.
